Exercise

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index. A
scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations
each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5
citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3
citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each,
his h-index is 3.
